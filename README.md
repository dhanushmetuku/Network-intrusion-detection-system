#NIDS-ML: Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
üìå About the Project
NIDS-ML is a Machine Learning-based system designed to detect network intrusions and malicious activities in real-time or offline network traffic data. As cyber threats continue to evolve, it's crucial to build intelligent and scalable solutions that can identify unauthorized access, DoS attacks, port scans, and other malicious patterns with high accuracy.

This project utilizes supervised learning techniques to classify network traffic into normal or attack categories. It serves as a foundational system for security analysts, researchers, and developers aiming to build next-generation intrusion detection systems.

 Introduction
This project implements classic and modern ML algorithms to detect intrusions in a computer network. It includes:

Feature selection and preprocessing from popular datasets like KDD99, NSL-KDD, or CICIDS2017

Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks

Real-time or batch prediction pipeline for classifying new network traffic samples

Performance metrics including confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

The ultimate goal is to build a system that‚Äôs not only accurate but also interpretable and deployable in real-world scenarios.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Tool/Library	Version
Python	3.8 / 3.9
NumPy	1.23.1
Pandas	1.5.3
Scikit-learn	1.2.2
Matplotlib	3.7.1
XGBoost (optional)	1.7.0+
TensorFlow/Keras	2.12 (if using DNN/CNN)

üí° Tip: Use virtualenv or conda for isolated environments.
