# NIDS-ML: Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

## üìå About the Project

**NIDS-ML** is a Machine Learning-based system designed to detect **network intrusions and malicious activities** in real-time or from offline network traffic data.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, it's crucial to build intelligent and scalable solutions that can identify:
- Unauthorized access  
- DoS/DDoS attacks  
- Port scans  
- Other malicious patterns  

This project uses **supervised learning techniques** to classify traffic into **normal or attack** categories. It serves as a foundational tool for security analysts, researchers, and developers to build next-gen intrusion detection systems.

This project implements both **classic and modern ML algorithms** to detect intrusions. Features:

-   Feature selection and preprocessing from datasets like:
  - KDD99
  - NSL-KDD
  - CICIDS2017  
-   Model training using:
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks  
-   Real-time or batch prediction  
-   Performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

Our goal: A model that‚Äôs **accurate, interpretable**, and **deployable** in real-world systems.
